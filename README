Thrift libraries for JavaScript, especially for Node.js

Now in phase of early development, nothing is working right now and Github is just a backup storage

Goal of this project is to create comprehensive Thrift server in Node.js

Planned features:
 - Protocol support: Binary, JSON
 - Transport support: TCP, Unix socket, HTTP (all of them both client and/or server)
 - All calls asynchronous - using callbacks
 - Server for Node.js
